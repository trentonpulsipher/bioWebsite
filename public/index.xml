      <description>Employment Henry Schein One
Sr Data Scientist (American Fork, UT) Apr 2017 - Present
As the lone data scientist at Henry Schein One I lead efforts to build predictive modeling via machine learning algorithms, promote data governance and business process documentation, and regularly share analytical best practices.
Created web-based tools to share statistical modeling visualizations with the sales, customer success, and marketing teams internally. Built in Linux, these analytical tools allow for sharing of interactive JavaScript based apps via HTML pages in an R markdown/blogdown/Hugo generated website.</description>

      <description>Iâ€™m a data scientist / statistician with over 10 years of experience analyzing everything from customer attrition to ovarian cancer biomarkers to weather modeling to protein pKa predictions to power grid load demand to organic lettuce sales. I primarily use R, which enables me to use RMarkdown, various wrappers for JavaScript plotting libraries (rBokeh, Leaflet, trelliscopejs, etc.), and an appropriate backend like Hadoop or Spark.
Outside of work I try to enjoy supporting my wife in our effort to fix up our small old house while pretending to be country farmers on our acre property (lots of fruit and nut trees, and chickens).</description>
