<h1>Employment</h1>
<p><em>Henry Schein One</em></p>
<p>Sr Data Scientist (American Fork, UT) Apr 2017 - Present</p>
<p>As the lone data scientist at Henry Schein One I lead efforts to build predictive modeling via machine learning algorithms, promote data governance and business process documentation, and regularly share analytical best practices.</p>
<p>Created web-based tools to share statistical modeling visualizations with the sales, customer success, and marketing teams internally. Built in Linux, these analytical tools allow for sharing of interactive JavaScript based apps via HTML pages in an R markdown/blogdown/Hugo generated website.</p>
<p>By applying automated machine learning predictive methods to customers at-risk of attrition expected savings are $10M+ within three years. Currently implementing these same methods and framework to improve marketing messaging and sales lead generation. Also supporting the business operations team’s effort to improve the data warehouse architecture, dimensional modeling, and reporting services (Tableau).</p>
<p><em>Category Partners</em></p>
<p>Sr Analyst (Idaho Falls, ID) Apr 2016 - Apr 2017</p>
<p>Led the analysis, visualization/dashboard efforts of IRI/Nielsen syndicated data for grower/shipper clients in the produce category as part of a five person startup.</p>
<p><em>The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints</em></p>
<p>Data Analyst / Statistician (Salt Lake City, UT) Dec 2014 - Apr 2016</p>
<p>Responsible for all data science related analytical efforts within the Missionary department, including: data wrangling, modeling, predictive analytics, visualization, data discovery/exploration, and communication of results to the highest level of leaders/executives in the Church.</p>
<p><em>Pacific Northwest National Laboratory</em></p>
<p>Statistician (Richland, WA) Jul 2009 - Dec 2014</p>
<p>Implemented Bayesian model averaging (BMA) as an ensemble-based method to incorporate predictions from multiple experts or model systems. Successful application of BMA in modeling of response surfaces numerically generated from multiple expert-derived conceptual models characterizing sites for carbon sequestration, and have improved predictive performance for ensemble-based applications in image classification (computer vision), power grid demand modeling, pKa protein analysis, and sensor degradation signature discovery. Coauthored multiple peer-reviewed journal articles and conference papers demonstrating expertise in BMA related applications.</p>
<p>Developed statistical methodology to spatially allocate weather similar regions using climate data. Reduction of the number of weather similar regions and of the number of building types will save climate modelers and power grid researchers at least hundreds of hours of computation and analysis time when using PNNL’s complex regional earth systems simulation modeling framework, PRIMA. Implemented PAM clustering to adequately describe a subset of representative building types. Managed Big Data and parallelized statistical computations using Rhipe, an R package designed to interact with the Hadoop framework via Map/Reduce on PNNL’s institutional supercomputer.</p>
<p>Performed multiple complex data analyses for other project work related to a variety of areas, including: building energy modeling, power grid modeling, bio-forensics of biowarfare growth media, river salmon population studies, air chemical analysis, uncertainty quantification for visualization of carbon sequestration, and several early drug development clinical trial related analyses.</p>
<p><em>Massachusetts General Hospital</em></p>
<p>Biostatistician (Boston, MA) Jun 2007 - Jul 2009</p>
<p>Tested models for early detection of ovarian cancer in clinical trial data. Examined longitudinal protein biomarker profiles from blood/serum. Calculated sensitivity and specificity for predicted data from logistic regression of potential biomarker combinations from cancer case/control studies.</p>
